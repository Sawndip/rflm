Random Forest Language Model Toolkit Installation Guide

0. Install SRILM Toolkit (http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/). 

1. Unpack rflm.tar.gz and put it under your SRILM top-level directory. 
   For example,

$ tar xzf rflm.tar.gz -C /Users/yisu/local/srilm-1.5.7
   
2. Set the SRILM variable in the Makefile to point to your SRILM top-level 
   direcoty.

$ emacs /Users/yisu/local/srilm-1.5.7/rflm/src/Makefile
...
SRILM=/Users/yisu/local/srilm-1.5.7
...

3. Build the RFLM Toolkit from the src directory.

$ cd /Users/yisu/local/srilm-1.5.7/rflm/src
$ make 
$ make release

4. Now you should be able to invoke the binaries from your main SRILM
   binary path. For example,

$ /Users/yisu/local/srilm-1.5.7/bin/macosx/rfngram-count -help

Refer to the INSTALL file of the SRILM Toolkit for more options and information.
