To-do list:

- Update rfngram-count.cc with the latest SRI LM Toolkit; rfngram-count.cc 
  is based on ngram-count.cc from SRI LM Toolkit 1.4.3; Same for rfngram.cc .

- Client-server LM is now available in SRI LM Toolkit; should consolidate and
  use theirs.

- Read and write trees in binary format; should see speedup for large trees.

DISCLAIMER
  With high probability, I will *not* have time to do any of the above 
  in the near future. Think of it as "what I think this toolkit could be
  improved".
